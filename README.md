# emacs-evil-vim
These are the files I use to configure my working copy of text editors since I have transitioned,
recently, from my long-time friend Vi/Vim to Emacs. I use this repository to keep track of it
across different platforms on which I use Emacs: macOS, FreeBSD, Linux, and even Windows.
Consider it a starting point for your customisation if you need to start somewhere, however if
you are going to rely on Emacs there is no doubt you will end up building your own .emacs. It is 
a rite of passsage of sorts.

Emacs is a better and a far more configurable
editor, using LISP, and with SLIME/SWANK it supports pretty much any other LISP, such as Common Lisp,
out of the box. It is a joy to use. Unfortunately, Emacs causes repetitive strain injury
due to its torturous modifier key combinations (Ctrl-Alt-x-Ctrl-X-Ctrl-B-Ctrl-O-1). Vim does not.
Emacs-Evil is the best of both worlds, bringing Vim keybindings to Emacs.

Please note, this is a personal set-up and some of it will need to be modified or tidied up by you
to make it work in your environment, especially the SLIME section. If you do not use SLIME, just
comment it out.

*Enjoy!*
