# emacs-evil-vim
These are the files I use to configure my working copy of text editors since I have transitioned,
recently, from my long-time friend Vi/Vim to Emacs.

Emacs is a better and a far more configurable
editor, using LISP, and with SLIME/SWANK it supports pretty much any other LISP, such as Common Lisp,
out of the box. It is a joy to use. Unfortunately, Emacs causes repetitive strain injury
due to its torturous modifier key combinations (Ctrl-Alt-x-Ctrl-X-Ctrl-B-Ctrl-O-1). Vim does not.
Emacs-Evil is the best of both worlds, bringing Vim keybindings to Emacs.
